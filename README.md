# Generate Fake Cat Face Pictures with DCGAN

## Brief Introduction to Our Problem
Our goal is to generate cat pictures using GAN.

Our first attempt is to generate cats including its body, however the result is not that good. Thus we tried to generate only cat faces. The result using only cat faces to train is brilliant. After some epochs, the cat faces generated by the generator are really similar to the real cat faces.

## Brief Introduction to Github Code we Refer to
Codes we refer to: [DCGAN_Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html)
This tutorial uses DCGAN to generate new celebrities from real celebritiesâ€™ images.

## Results
Below is the comparison of fake and real cat faces after training 40 epochs.
